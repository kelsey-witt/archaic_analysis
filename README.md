# archaic_analysis

This repository contains the code needed to repeat the analyses used in "Apportioning archaic variants among modern populations", published in *Philosophical Transactions B* by Witt and colleagues in 2022. The publication is open access and available [here] (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0411).

The aim of this study was to examine how archaic ancestry is distributed across modern global populations and to look for differences in allele frequencies and the number of alleles present in each population. We compared the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 dataset to the four high-coverage archaic humans and the primary metric we used is "archaic ancestry coverage", which compares how many archaic SNPs found in an individual compares to the total number of archaic SNPs found across any individual in a population.

## Data Used
* [1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 VCF files](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/)
* High-Coverage archaic genomes for the [Altai Neanderthal](http://cdna.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/altai/AltaiNeandertal/), [Vindija Neanderthal](http://ftp.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/Vindija/) Chagyrskaya Neanderthal(http://ftp.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/Chagyrskaya/), and [Denisovan](http://cdna.eva.mpg.de/denisova/)
* [Simons Genome Diversity Project Data](https://reichdata.hms.harvard.edu/pub/datasets/sgdp/) - specifically the Papuan genomes
The following datasets are only needed for follow-up analyses or confirmations of our results using other datasets.
* [Sprime archaic site calls](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/y7hyt83vxr/1)
* [Introgression tracts from Steinruecken et al. 2018](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.revproxy.brown.edu/doi/full/10.1111/mec.14565)
* [Introgression tracts from Sankararaman et al. 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27032491/)
